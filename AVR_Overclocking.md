# Modern AVRs and overclocking
This is written from the context of modern AVRs *however* much of it applies to classic AVRs as well. This document was excised from a planned response to an issue where it was largely off topic, but contained enough information to be of value, hence needed to be retained somewhere

## AVRs are well known to (at least at room temperature) overclock extremely well, likely because they are designed to function at temperatures of up to 125C
Typically at their maximum spec'ed operating speed. This means they hacve oodles of headroom at more moderate temperatures typical of non-industrial, non-automotive applications.

### Overclocking Dx-series
On AVR Dx-series parts, is achieved two ways:
* Changing the MCLKCTRL register of the CLKCTRL. On the Dx-series, above 4 MHz, the granularity of this is 4 MHz, going from 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 MHz according the to spec. In reality, there are two "secret" speeds not mentioned in the datasheet. Setting the bitfield to a value 1 or 2 higher than 24 MHz results in operating frequency of 28 or 32 MHz respectively. Most parts can do either of these no problem.
* For larger overclocks, the tuning is of little use for overclocking, due to the limited range. However, they can all take an external clock, and DD and DB parts can also use a crystal. I am aware of crystals working reliably on most E-spec (extended temp) parts at 40. External clocks always work better and always have for overclocking AVRs, and 48 MHz has been found stable on at least one E-spec DB (but not on an I-spec one).

### Overclocking tinyAVR parts
On tinyAVR, the internal oscillator is incredibly flexible, and is the primary method used to overclock: 1-series parts will do 24-25 no problem and most will do 30, though they fall apart above that. With solid supply rails at an external clock, though, they can be pushed to 32. 2-series parts will usually work fine on internal oscillator at 32, and collapse in the mid-30's just about at the top of the calibration range for the oscillator. This epic compliance of the internal oscillator makes these MUCH more fun to overclock :-)
The datasheet makes a point of warning users not to change calibration by large amounts all at once. This is not new. However, study of the arcane code written by wizards of that sort has indicated that there is a "trick" to get around this, which I use succcessfully: Simply follow the write to the cal register immediately with a NOP. The source of voodoo practice is the widely used digispark-alikes, which like the run at 16.5 (classic AVRs, 8.0 MHz nominal, passed through a PLL to multiply by 8 and divide by 4, tuned upwards for a base F_CPU of 8.25, multiplied by 2 (net) yeilding 16.5, which is better for USB on the marginal oscillator of classic AVRs. 

The theoretical groundings of that practice are convincing provided that the assumptions it rests upon are correct (though this is not known to be the case) The most frequent case of incorrect execution is 1 bits in the result being set to 0 instead; this was noticed immediately when doing overclocking trials on tinyAVRs  (random garbage values can also happen too, though I can't rule out the possibility that those were from an intermediate experiencing 1->0 errors;), the voodoo solution appears to be supported. If the "no-zero-to-one-errors" conjecture is true, and if the assumption that abrupt clock change induced errors are similar to overclock induced errors is valid, that would make the use of a NOP (or possibly two nops - (not a `_NOP2()` which is a rjmp .+0, a great way to get a 2 cycle nop for a single instruction word and commonly used in cyclecounting based time critical code, but `_NOP(); _NOP();`, which is actually a pair of 0x0000 nop instructions) clearly the correct thing to do to eliminate improper execution after a large change to the clock speed - not only does it not do anything, the fact that the opcode is 0x0000 means that even if the instruction fetch glitches, if it can only clear 1 bits to 0, then it cannot transform the nop into amything else. Howevwe if these assumptions are not valid, then conclusion is not supported either

#### More about how crazy the tinyAVR internal osc is, and what tools could make overclocking more useful
Modern tinyAVRs are more interesting to overclock than Dx (on Dx. the cal is pretty worthless. Granularity is too large to really trim the oscillator accurately, hence autotune is of limited value, and there are so few steps, that they can't swing the speed far enough to expose new practical clock speeds) - of course  you can overclock to 32 MHz just by just setting a value 2 higher than the value for 24 MHz (that's as far as it goes - after that the last 4 just repeat). I don't think I've ever seen that not work at room temp.). On tinies, though, he internal oscillator is nuts: 64 steps from ~4/8ths nominal up to 13/8ths nominal on the 1-series, and 128 steps from around 5/8ths through 15/8ths of nominal on 2-series. I have seen only one part that would reproducibly run the cal routine all the way up to the maximum while remaining stable enough to run my tuning sketch without apparent errors - (a couple would occasionally make it through - but have gotten some errors, which means they could not be used at this speed) this part also had an unusually slow internal oscillator, such that it simply couldn't reach high enough speeds to malfunction at room temperature). The transition from no apparent errors to visible errors happening very often happens over a change of less than 1 MHz, but that still means that these parts all have several cal settings at which they are struggling to various extents. That would be an interesting laboratory for exploring the behavior of AVRs that fail to excecute instructions correctely due to exceeded operating conditions. IMO an ideal investigation would need to know which instructions were most sensitive, I'm imagining like, using a part known to be in the struggling regime at a certain cal, T, and V, starting at normal speed, then running a test functions in asm for each instruction, Part of this could be proceedurally generated and should be, as a good test would be quite long, where you'd go to inline assembly push everything, ldi a start value into some registers, ldi the new speed and the CCP value, then out ccp, sts new cal, nop nop, then a long sequence of the same instruction with minor changes. Like starting with 4 bytes of data to mangle, you then have a sequence of subi's. Declare that there shalt be 256 subis, with all possible immediate values. each data byte could be the destination of 64 of those, (probably want to distribute randomly), with the order of the immediate values randomized as well. Then, turn the CPU speed back down, you should be running in clean territory now. so store than 4 byte value to memory, restore all the registers - but pop them into r0, compare with the value in their home register, and then mov them there. If any register you didn't use is changed, that's something to investigate. For example, if you targeted registers 20, 21, 22, 23, and then you look at what wound up in those vs what did at in-spec clock speed, and found that r20 was different, and your register scan revealed that r16 was wrongly changed, and you then see that the two are wrong by the same amount, and confirm that yes that amount is one of the numbers you tried to subi from r20, you would suspect that the 1-bit in the register section of the subi opcode was misread as a 0, and the operation otherwise carried out successfully. On the other hand if you saw no damage to other registers, saw evidence of only a single error, but the value was not one of the ones subtracted from that byte, nor was it the sum of any two (note - converse not true for a single sample, as chance of false positive is pretty high), you would instead suspect that the immediate value was what got mangled. If the error was a power of two off, you would strongly suspect that. Multiple runs under the same condition using several randomly generated sequences, each multiple times, would reveal if the errors were distributed randomly across the opcode, or if there was a correlation between the opcode for that instruction (that is, between the operands) and the chance of error or not (both are plausible a priori). This could be repeated for each instruction (procedural generation of the asm, like I said, is a must). At the end you would be in a position to determine: 
a) What instruction are the most likely to fail to execute?
b) What instruction operands are most likely to fail to execute? (or does it not matter, which implies that reading the instruction from that bus isn't the weak link) 
Then if the same process were performed on a few specimens, you'd learn the most important things
c) Whether the same instructions are the weakest ones on all devices, or vary part-to-part?
d) whether that can be put into practice to develop a single short routine composed of a large number of sensitive isns, which give a trustworthy answer to the question "Is the chip stable at the current operating conditions?"

With such a tool in hand, an expanse of uncharted territory is ripe for exploration, as you could run up the clock speed like a tuning sketch, and recognize when it had started struggling and make a 3-dimensional plot of that versus temperature and voltage. Finally, if enough data was taken at one of the "speed grade" voltages for varying temperature, you would likely get a plot that you could fit a curve to, extrapolate to the manufacturer spec max speed, thus revealing how much headroom they designed for, and from there you could likely synthesize a h(V, T, F_CPU) which would indicate how comfortable the chip was running in those circumstances, ie, for all V, T you would know F_CPUmax, ie, F_CPUmax(V,T), so h(V, T, F_CPU), the headroom, would be 1-F_CPU/F_CPUmax(V,T). Now F_CPUmax(V,T) of course would have to have specimen-dependant constants. The number of such constants, assuming they're not correllated exactly, is the number of points on the V,T plane you'd need to measure F_CPUmax for for any given specimen in order to predict its headroom over all conditions
